#### Other Projects
- Golden Pig Demo, which was showed on IDF(Intel Developer Forum) 2007 spring(Beijing).

	-      I designed and implemented the display system with OpenGL.
	-      The demo simulates the motion of 20,000 atoms in limited space.
	-      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_kN0JqSq7o

- Drive-aid system, which was Showed on IDF 2008 spring(Beijing).

	- I designed and implemented the display system with MFC. The Drive-aid system detects the objects nearby through analyzing the video captured by camera, and displays the objects to the driver. 
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1vgnaWMWDU

- Library of String matching algorithms, includes:
	- Single pattern sting matching algorithms and Multiple pattern string matching algorithms.
	- The strstr function optimized with SSE2, 4~10x speedup to strstr of glibc. My implementation is the only one in the world that is optimized with SSE2 instruction set.
	- The strstr function optimized with SSE4.2, faster than the SSE4.2 implementation in the latest glibc. My implementation uses the aligned memory access, which is why it can be faster than that in glibc.
	- Accessing the source code: git clone https://github.com/zhenghuadai/strstrsse.git
	- The Library is used by Enlightenment project (http://enlightenment.org/)

-  A tool of processing and analyzing video and image, including
	- Collection of video and image processing algorithms.
	- A compiler that compiles high level video processing script/language into x86 binary code.
	- http://code.google.com/p/videoanalyze/

-  Photowater android app
	- Photowater embeds string into jpeg picture as hidden watermark.
